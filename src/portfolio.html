        <p>This is a command line app made using Ruby. I wanted to make something fun that could
provide a bit of entertainment and thought about how much I loved playing Hangman with my Dad growing
up so I decided to make my own version. Because I'm a huge cat lover I included a lot of ASCII cats 
to try and make it a little bit more interesting. So far I haven't been able to find any way to break
it but please feel free to clone the repo and give it a try yourself! You can play with friends or
there's a single player mode.</p>

        <p>This is a pure CSS pixel art dabbing unicorn that I made. Why a dabbing unicorn? Why not?
He's fabulous. I wanted to play around with CSS a bit and also make something fun so I had a look for 
some images online and thought this guy was too cute not to try and replicate. He's made using two divs,
one for the pixel art itself and the other is there for positioning, and SCSS because there were so many
colours and I find naming variables a lot more intuitive using SCSS.</p>

        <p>This little guy is another CSS pixel art project. If you're anything like me you probably grew up
playing a lot of pokemon as a kid. I wanted to keep playing around with CSS pixel art so I made Charmander. If 
you go and visit my <a href="https://codepen.io/Ash-Eileen" target="_blank"><strong><u>codepen</u></strong></a> you'll find that I've
made all of the original starters as well as Pikachu, because who doesn't love that little electric mouse. Making 
CSS pixel art is something I find really relaxing so I might add the second generation starters as well.</p>

              <p>This is where you are! My portfolio website. This website is designed to showcase my skills and 
my projects. It also serves as a bit of an introduction to who I am. This site was made using HTML and SCSS. I wanted
to ensure the site was accessible so all colours have been tested to ensure they're WCAG AAA compliant and I have also
tried to ensure that semantic HTML tags have been used to make sure the page is accessible to devices such as screen 
readers. I tested a few different themes for the site but found this combination of dark blue with green and pink accents
to be the most appealing to me.</p>
