## Description

### Purpose

This portfolio website was designed to be my personal professional portfolio. It is designed to showcase:

* My programming skills by:
  * Showing my tech stack in the skills section on the about page.
  * Showcasing my personal and professional projects on the portfolio page.

* Ways that I can be contacted including my social media links which include some of my personal projects.

* An about me section to show a bit of my personality.

### Functionality/Features

This site was designed with a mobile first approach and various pages highlighting different information.

#### Navigation

On the mobile and tablet versions of the site I have utilised a hamburger menu for navigation. This is laid out to the right side of the screen to make reaching the menu button easier. The way the menu is animated it looks like it's folding down from the top of the screen.

The mobile and tablet versions of the site are designed as single columns to make viewing the information easier. The differences between the mobile and tablet site are slight such as different text being displayed on the homepage, text size and icon size increasing and the layout of the skills being wider as tablets provide more room.

The desktop version of the site has a menu across the top of the screen and each menu option highlights in a different colour on hover with borders appearing on the right and left. I considered fixing this to the top of the screen, however, since the pages are not exceedingly long reconsidered this.

There is a footer at the bottom of each page with links to my social media accounts, except on the homepage as my social media links are displayed in the main content. The social media icons change colour, size and animate on hover which I thought was a nice detail.

#### Index/Homepage

I didn't want my homepage to be filled with too much information. I chose to set the background to be one colour with a brief introduction and links to my social media accounts. On the homepage my social media links all have animations to make it a bit more interactive.

#### About Page

This section is designed to provide a bit of an introduction to who I am. This is slightly different from the homepage as I added a background for the main content so that I could highlight the text more with coloured boxes around them. In mobile/tablet view it is set as one column, however, in desktop view I wanted to create a bit more movement on the page. In the top history section it is set out with my picture and a bit of my history, I then wanted to highlight my skills directly below that and included a link to a dummy resume. This is followed by my interests which is laid out the same way as the history section, however, the image and text are reversed.

#### Portfolio

This section is designed to show off my previous work. On mobile/tablet I wanted to highlight each item individually so the projects are stacked in a column, however, in the desktop version I thought it would be better to place two projects side by side. Each project has an image respresenting it and the title shows what language it was created with and acts as a link to the repo. On hover on the titles they change colour to highlight that they are links.

#### Blog

Per the requirements of this assessment I have included a blog section with dummy blogs. Each blog has its own box as a container to break up the text. On the mobile/desktop version of the site these are stacked but like the about page I wanted to create more movement on the desktop site. Each blog has the image to the side and then all text on the opposing side, the side the image appears on switches for each blog.

#### Contact

The contact page has a dummy contact form for users. It also provides my social media links for twitter and linkedin which animate on hover. I also set the button to scale on hover so it made it a little bit more interesting.

#### Tablet

The tablet follows the same design as the mobile version of the site. The differences are on the index/homepage where the text changes and on the about page where the amount of skill icons displayed is changed.
